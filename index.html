  <h1>MCPs are now useless</h1>
    <p>Models are becoming twice as good at coding than every 4 months.</p>
    <p>MCps were introduced as a way to introduce tools to these LLM models, however, now a days a lot of tools are included by different providers like executing code or doing websearch</p>
    
    <p>Now that a lot of providers have their own tools, it causes problems when we try to add a lot of tools from our side. Having 10 different tools for example might have the opposite effect that model might not use MCP tools or even use them the wrong way because you're polluting the context with so much MCP information.</p>
    <p>A lot of times you have to tell it to use the MCP server to get a certain task done, which is not the behavior we want from an agentic model.</p>

    <p>There are really only 3 MCP servers that will help us in development:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Read & Validate Data</li>
      <li>Use the browser</li>
      <li>Get up-to-date documentation</li>
    </ul> 

    <p>Cursor and a lot of all these other AI tools already have a lot of these capabilities without the need of polluting the context.</p>
    <p>They can use the command line to interact with git, which allows them to interact with sqlite for databases.</p>
